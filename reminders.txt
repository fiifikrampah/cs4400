Reminders of tasks - Fiifi:

1. Solve email multivalued attributes






Reminders of tasks - Nicholas:
1. buttons in the table headers to sort by that column criteria (for example on screen 15)
    - the sorting needs to be done with sql, not using javascript
2. none of the back buttons work, for some reason the render_template doesn't recognized the html files?
    (for example:)
    ERROR: TemplateNotFound: 11-manvisitfunc.html
3. text inputs in forms should not submit the form when enter is pressed
5. zipcode should be held as a string to support leading zeros, doesn't have to be just 5 digits in case of a zip extension,
    also only supports inputs of digits0-9 and hyphen(-)

    -replace 'Employee' in the results table with the specific employee type that user is, and ensure filter works accordingly
    -approve button
    -decline button

screen22-
    -edit button
    -delete button

screen24-
    -create button

screen25-
    -not all events show up like they should, my guess is that this is caused when the events don't have attendees?
        results will not show events that have total visits = 0 (because they won't be counted from taketransit and therefore
        wont get joined)
    -edit button
    -delete button
