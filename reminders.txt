Reminders of tasks - Fiifi:

1. Solve email multivalued attributes






Reminders of tasks - Nicholas:
1. buttons in the table headers to sort by that column criteria (for example on screen 15)
    - the sorting needs to be done with sql, not using javascript
2. none of the back buttons work, for some reason the render_template doesn't recognized the html files?
    (for example:)
    ERROR: TemplateNotFound: 11-manvisitfunc.html
3. text inputs in forms should not submit the form when enter is pressed
