Reminders of tasks - Nicholas:
2. none of the back buttons work, for some reason the render_template doesn't recognized the html files?
    (for example:)
    ERROR: TemplateNotFound: 11-manvisitfunc.html

screen18-
    -replace 'Employee' in the results table with the specific employee type that user is, and ensure filter works accordingly
    -approve button
    -decline button

screen22, 23, 24-
    -delete button

screen23-
    -we need a cascade or something so that when the route name is changed, it also gets changed in the taketransit and
        connect tables

screen25-
    -not all events show up like they should, my guess is that this is caused when the events don't have attendees?
        results will not show events that have total visits = 0 (because they won't be counted from taketransit and therefore
        wont get joined)
    -edit button
    -delete button
